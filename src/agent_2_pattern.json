  "reasoning": "No spam patterns detected. The email contains specific details (dates: January 5-6, December 25-January 1, reference to 'fall semester', 'calendar that I handed out'). These are strong indicators of legitimate business correspondence. No pharmaceutical keywords, no software offers, no financial schemes. No suspicious URLs present. The reference to a previously distributed calendar and a scheduled organizational retreat indicates this is internal communication within a known group. Risk level is LOW - no malicious indicators found."
